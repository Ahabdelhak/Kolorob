* This is to notify to whoever works on this project; app structure is fully developed by junior developers; so it does not follow optimised
* coding pattern fully. Moreover; Code structure got changed due to new feature integration/New UX etc and
* same code been rewritten or tried to hold new component in lieu of completely write new code every time. So please don't curse us
* if you get lost in our messy coding!THis is the best we could manage without any expert support. We suggest you debug the app and go through each and every function one by one. This will help!
*
* Thanks! :)
